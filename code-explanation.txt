JavaScript: 

The code is a JavaScript script that handles the game logic and functionality for the Rock Paper Scissors game. Here's an explanation of the different functions and variables:

- `var playerScore = 0;`: Represents the player's score and initializes it to 0.
- `var computerScore = 0;`: Represents the computer's score and initializes it to 0.
- `var roundsPlayed = 0;`: Keeps track of the number of rounds played and initializes it to 0.
- `var playerName = "";`: Stores the player's name and initializes it to an empty string.

- `function startGame()`: This function is called when the "Start Game" button is clicked. It retrieves the player's name from the input field and checks if it is not empty. If the name is valid, it hides the profile form and displays the game container.

- `function playGame(playerChoice)`: This function is called when the player selects a choice (rock, paper, or scissors). It generates a random choice for the computer, compares the player's choice with the computer's choice, and determines the round result. The player and computer scores are updated accordingly, and the scoreboard is updated. The result is displayed, and the choices are animated. The roundsPlayed variable is incremented, and if it reaches 3, the endGame() function is called.

- `function updateScoreboard()`: Updates the player and computer scores on the scoreboard in the HTML document.

- `function showResult(playerChoice, computerChoice, result)`: Displays the player's choice, computer's choice, and round result in the HTML document.

- `function animateChoices(playerChoice, computerChoice)`: Animates the player's and computer's choices by adding appropriate CSS classes to the animationContainer element. After a delay of 1.5 seconds, the animationContainer is cleared.

- `function endGame()`: Displays the final result of the game based on the player and computer scores. If the player has a higher score, they are declared the overall winner. If the computer has a higher score, it is declared the overall winner. If both have the same score, it's declared a tie.

- `function disableChoices()`: Disables the choice buttons by setting the disabled property to true for each button.

The JavaScript code manages the game state, updates the scores and results, and handles the overall game flow, ensuring a functional and interactive Rock Paper Scissors game experience.
